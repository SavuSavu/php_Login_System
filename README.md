# php_Login_System

The code has comments with everything you need to know.

In the comments where you see "!!!" that means you need to read and change according to your needs/requirements!

There is an Style folder with a style.css file inside that is empty. 
The html part of the code has classes, all you need to do in order for this project to work is to add some style and change things were you see "!!!".     

Good luck and I hope this was helpful!
